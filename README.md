# Welcome to the Skill Exploration Task

This part of the recruitment does not merely test your knowledge of specific 
technologies. Frameworks come and go--but the developer spirit stays as seasons
change!

## 🏆 Your Task
We present you an incomplete implementation of a **Course Enlistment System**.
This system uses a **library that renders course information**. Your task is 
to **familiarize yourself with the library and complete the implementation.**

To do this, you will be given tons of resources--documentation, usage guide, 
and source code. It is up to you how to manage this.

### 🎯 Specific Tasks

- [ ] Populate the list with the given course offerings
- [ ] Initialize the rendering library object
- [ ] Create a notification modal every time the student enlists a course
- [ ] Create a notification modal every time the student drops a course

### 🏅 Bonus Tasks!!

If this is too easy for you and you want to show off, you can choose any (if not
all) of the bonus tasks below:
- [ ] Create an error modal every time the student tries to enlist a subject
even if the current units go beyond the maximum allowed units.
- [ ] Style the application accordingly to give it a modern and UX-friendly face.

## 🔍 What Matters Most

This isn't just about getting the code to work! In fact, the final outcome matters
less than the following:
- Your Thought Process - Explain why you made certain choices
- Debugging Skills - How do you approach and fix issues?
- Resourcefulness & Adaptability - How do you leverage documentation and AI tools 
responsibly?
- Communication Skills - How thoroughly do you communicate and ask clarifying 
questions?

## ⚙️ AI Usage Guidelines
💡 You can use AI tools (like ChatGPT) to brainstorm, debug, or research concepts. 

However:
🔴 **Strict Rule:** 🚫 Do NOT copy-paste AI-generated code. 
Your implementation should reflect your own thought process, not AI’s output.


✅ You may use AI for:
- Brainstorming approaches
- Debugging strategies
- Learning unfamiliar syntax
- Understanding error messages

Your final output should reflect your own reasoning and problem-solving.

## ✅ Success Checklist
Before wrapping up, make sure you can check these off:
- [ ] The course list loads dynamically.
- [ ] The rendering library works correctly with the data.
- [ ] Modals appear correctly on enlistment and dropping.
- [ ] Code is structured, readable, and well-commented.
- [ ] (Bonus) Additional features enhance UX or enforce business logic.

## 📤 Submission & Evaluation
### 🖥️ Onsite Process
- You will be completing this task on our machine (if onsite) or on a remote setup 
like Replit.
- Work will be assessed live as you go along. At the end, we also engage in a 
retrospective discussion.

### 🔍 How You’ll Be Evaluated
Your work will be reviewed based on:
- ✔️ Correctness of implementation
- ✔️ How well you explain your thought process
- ✔️ Debugging approach and problem-solving mindset
- ✔️ How well you ask clarifying questions

# 🎉 Have Fun & Good Luck!

Remember, this task is about learning and problem-solving. Don’t stress if things 
get tricky--just show us how you think and adapt! 

We're here for you, not against you ;)

🚀 Ready? Let’s go! 🎯
